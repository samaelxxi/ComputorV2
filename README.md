# ComputorV2
Simple 42 project.

ComputorV2 it's simple interpreter, which could handle different math types(numbers, complex numbers, matrices) and objects(variables, functions).
Things that are supported:
- +, -, *, /, %, ^
- brackets
- definition of variables and functions
- solving equations of powers 0, 1, 2
- built-in functions like sin(), cos(), exp(), log()...
- matrix inversion and tranposition
- plottion
- linear regression func(linreg(A, B)) which takes two one-dimensional matrices, find best-fit line and plots it
- vars() and funcs() commands that print all interpreter variables and functions respectively

My main purpose during this project was to practice python OOP skills and try TDD paradigm.
